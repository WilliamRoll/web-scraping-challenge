# web-scraping-challenge

In this assignment I scraped multiple different websites for Mars data as well as images. Utilized splinter to navigate to the sites and used BeautifulSoup to find and parse the data.

Mission_to_Mars contains the Jupyter Notebook. Scrape_mars is the python file that will perform the scraping in the main directory. app is the Python file that will connect to Mongo, and scrape. HTML index file is contained within templates folder.

Grader: If an "IndexError: list index out of range" occurs, please just refresh the page. For some reason this will occur when trying to scrape, while other times it will not. Refreshing the page will allow it to run correctly. Thanks!
